# Student_performance_EDA
## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib scipy
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Student_Performance_Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Student_Performance_Analysis
```

3. Update the `file_path` variable in the script to point to your dataset location.

4. Run the script:
```bash
python student_performance_analysis.py
```

## 📝 Code Explanation

The script follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Import necessary libraries and load the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Encode categorical variables and split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Building**: Create a basic Decision Tree model and fit it to the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use Grid Search and Randomized Search to find the best hyperparameters.
6. **Feature Importances**: Display and plot the feature importances.
7. **Visualization**: Visualize the decision tree.

## 📊 Results

After running the script, you will get the accuracy of the basic Decision Tree model and the best parameters from Grid Search and Randomized Search. The script also plots the feature importances and visualizes the decision tree.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Student Performance Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams).
